; Exercise 1.5. Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether
; the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order
; evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))

; Then he evaluates the expression
(test 0 (p))

; What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that
; uses applicative-order evaluation?
; What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that
; uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer.
; (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form
; if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
; applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first,
; and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)


; SOLUTION:
; Note that ``p'' is recursively defined by itself. Therefore, for 
; the applicative-order evaluation, ``p'' will be evaluated in the 
; test, and this will lead to an infinite recursion. While in the 
; normal-order evaluation, the value of p is not evaluated, and 
; thus the test will return 0.
; Because normal order evaluation means that symbol is not evaluated until needed!
