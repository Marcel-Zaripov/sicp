## Intro  
This repository is a set of notes, highlights, and clippings from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", both from [the book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and [video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) to the course of the same name, interesting examples from the book, and solutions for the exercises.

## About the book
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by professors Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman is a prolific textbook aiming to teach the principles of computer programming, such as abstraction in programming, metalinguistic abstraction, recursion, interpreters, and modular programming. The book was formerly used at MIT as a manual for introductory programming classes and as such has its structure laid out in the manner alike the course schedule or outline.
  
Unlike many of its predecessors, which almost always concentrated on teaching details of a certain programming language, SICP aims at finding, defining, and explaining general and abstract programming paradigms, common to all programming languages. Due to that very fact, SICP remains to be relevant and extremely instructive source of knowledge, even though using Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, for explanation of concepts and paradigms, examples, and exercises.

The book also provides a great amount of fun and challenging exercises, which require rigor and dedication, as well as a voluminous lot of time. Tasks in exercises range from writing code for some puzzling problems to researching a particular subject matter or meticulously proving a statement or theorem with extensive induction. 


This high relevance, striking generality and applicability of broad Computer Science concepts, along with challenging exercises is what makes this book (along with some [MIT course material](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm)) a perfect tutorial for both beginners and experienced programmers, who aspire to acquire deep and thorough understanding of mind bending concepts and ideas of programming.

## Motivation
My main idea when reading the book, working through exercises, and compiling this repository is solely self-development and learning computer programming. I put all of the resources here for my personal use and no other intentions.  

However, you are more than welcome to view or use any of it. But please, if you find yourself puzzled with some exercises, do not jump to the solution right away as it forfeits your learning and defies the whole reason of reading and working through the book.
